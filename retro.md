-   just getting set up
-   nice that we started with the interface
-   similar to the idea to JOel.
-   in a comment just descrivbe
-   Think that he interface is clear enough on its onw.
-   not sure
-   sorry for stopping you, when you tried to help with the talking
-   improve the env. ex: fomatter

Diana

-   Going pretty well
-   Different going forward - make a commit!
-   Not completely aligned about the naming of functions / params; but ok since it's Nitsan's thing (it's not really)

Joel

-   interesting, we jumped in and we putt the interface for the cunion we want
-   normally we would write the test
-   onec you have the test, then you would fill in.
-   prefer to put the comment
-   comment, then test, then the production code
-   could we try to get something working with a regular pi test
-   before doing approval test
